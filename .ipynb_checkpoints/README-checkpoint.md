# Mock Transformations

This repo contains some practice transformations. So source data plus some basic requirements info so
people can practice selection and dimensioning mechanics.

This is intended as a onboarding/practice resource for data engineers, though it's also worth a look for
anyone that's completed the https://github.com/GSS-Cogs/databaker-walkthrough
