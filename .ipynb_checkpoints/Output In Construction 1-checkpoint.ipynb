    "We're looking to transform **tabs 1 and 2 only**.\n",

    "#### Observations & Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `observations` should be apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required dimensions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geography** - it's all UK level data (the code for UK is \"K02000001\")\n",
    "* **Time** - either a simple year, or a year followed by a quarter, i.e \"2002 Q2\"\n",
    "* **Adjustment** - either seasonal or non-seasonal\n",
    "* **Business** - concatenation of rows 6-9 around hyphens. i.e 'Other New Work - Excluding Infrastructure - Private Commercial'\n",
    "* **CDID** - ONS specific 4 letter codes. Typically on row 10 \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting the **Business** dimension cleanly is going to be tricky (read - cant see an obvious way to do it), I'd perhaps leave this one until last.\n",
    "* It's always worth getting the file out of /sources and having a look over.\n",
    "* You can't really take CDID as a dimension (dimension items needs to be repeating, not unqiue), it's a good exercise though as if doing this for real we'd likely be taking it as meta/supporting data."
